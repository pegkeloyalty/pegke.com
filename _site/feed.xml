        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-pegke-customer-loyalty-program&quot;&gt;What is Pegke Customer Loyalty Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pegke is an easy to use customer loyalty program or a reward point system, beneficial to both the business and the customer. Businesses drive attention of customers through customer loyalty programs by offering fantastic ways to reward and say thank you to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-pos-point-of-sale-&quot;&gt;What is a POS (point of sale) ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of sale (POS) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. At the point of sale, the merchant would prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout) or otherwise calculate the amount owed by the customer and provide options for the customer to make payment. After receiving payment, the merchant will also normally issue a receipt for the transaction, though increasingly a receipt is being dispensed with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top 5 Customer Loyalty Trends of 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In all actuality client experience does make a difference. Brands that can give fun, satisfying encounters through great deals stages and additional items like dedication projects have the capacity to catch more rehash clients, who pivot and get new clients they could call their own through image evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Omni-channel Engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic LOYALTY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client examination takes focal point of the audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personalization and accomplice showcasing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiential prizes = greatest effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui image fluid lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pegke.com/sites/default/files/uploads/top-5-customer-loyalty-trends-of-2015.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Loyalty Trends Of 2016&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;omni-channel-engagement&quot;&gt;1. Omni-channel Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer Loyalty Program venturing past the normal deals limits is one sign that marking has turn out to be more about thoughts than items. Clients have day in and day out access to the brands they cherish through online networking and cell phones. Brands, thusly, have new venues to achieve their center business without needing to envision pedestrian activity or exposures to outbound showcasing promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing in clients through substance or balanced cooperations makes a relationship that does not end at the checkout line. Brands that have the capacity to outfit the force of these numerous levels of correspondence to convey a firm, including brand message will be more inclined to succeed in an inexorably advanced environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enthusiastic-loyalty&quot;&gt;2. Enthusiastic LOYALTY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability projects are customarily considered as a rationale based quality suggestion. “Take an interest through these buys and get more esteem consequently,” are the directions conveyed to clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this simply right-cerebrum driven support is now and again insufficient. Client dedication can be all the more adequately earned through enthusiastic, left-cerebrum thinking also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-examination-takes-focal-point-of-the-audience&quot;&gt;3. Client examination takes focal point of the audience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring dedication has never been simple. For quite a long time, we’ve moved around various imperative KPIs. Details like LTV, RFM, recency of visit, number of prizes recovered, number of individuals in your reliability system, and others have helped us gage regardless of whether our endeavors in un-averingness are working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personalization-and-accomplice-showcasing&quot;&gt;4. Personalization and accomplice showcasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are bullish on this one. BigDoor is really fixated on partner showcasing, as we trust its vital to truly knowing how well your un-averingness endeavors are performing. Indeed, we keep a control client gather in every customer execution of our dedication program for this accurate reason — to demonstrate the amount of quality our innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experiential-prizes--greatest-effect&quot;&gt;5. Experiential prizes = greatest effect.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prizes matter. We all know this. The previous couple of years we’ve seen the greatest brands on the planet re-put into their clients and genuinely welcome them in an assortment of ways. We think 2015 will get a shift how clients are remunerated for dedication. As opposed to just give out rebates or your most recent organization swag, we think brands will conceptualize energizing, novel, experiential prizes for their most connected with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loyalty over the Holidays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid the extreme center of attention on scoring revenue in a sea of competitors, it can be easy to omit what must be the precedence — successful a patron who sticks round long after the ultimate slice of ham is eaten and the lights come down. If the value of loyalty escapes you, understand this: consistent with Harvard business review, growing patron retention rates by just 5% raises gains with the aid of 25% to 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-personal-connections-with-data&quot;&gt;1. Build personal connections with data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a be taught released in the Journal of applied Social Psychology, researchers learned that waiters were competent to broaden their suggestions by 23% quite simply by offering their purchasers a 2nd set of mints and framing the act as if it had been for them and them best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson to study right here is that a private, significant connection is predominant to getting probably the most out of persons, and how to attain that is through purchaser information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even some thing as simple as collecting data on whether or not a bought item is a gift can be utilized to ship a pleasant follow-up that offers the buyer something particular for himself or herself at the side of a question about how the present was once obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-the-small-print-a-big-deal&quot;&gt;2. Make the small print a big deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is notably actual for the ever-trendy reward voucher buy, where traditionally phrases and conditions are murkier territory. Being entirely obvious can ruin down what in any other case perhaps a barrier to buy and ensure the buyer and recipient’s experiences are incredibly confident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bring-real-life-online-and-vice-versa&quot;&gt;3. Bring real life, online and vice versa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still occupied with your small business internet site, social media platforms, web publication and actual lifestyles presence as separate entities with separate strategies: discontinue. The satisfactory advertising systems reside throughout your brand’s whole presence, creating one cohesive message that shows the world what you stand for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does this totally good with each and every celebration. This 12 months’s weird pink cup controversy is a testimony to how iconic the seasonal design tweak really is, and the company seamlessly integrates this in-retailer activation on-line with an Instagram pink Cup Contest which furnished content for Pinterest, facebook, and Twitter and a design tweak to deliver the festivities to the industry website. Regardless of a undoubtedly-large marketing price range, Starbucks still heralds easy recommendations and consistency throughout platforms - and strikes success every time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customer Retention Strategies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The results of customer retention additionally compound after some time, and in at times unforeseen ways. Indeed, even a modest change in customer retention can course through a business framework and increase after some time. The subsequent impact on long haul benefit and development shouldn’t be thought little of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-attrition&quot;&gt;1. Reducing Attrition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes each business loses a few customers, however few ever measure or perceive what number of their customers get to be inert. Most organizations, incidentally, contribute a tremendous measure of time, exertion and cost constructing that introductory customer relationship. At that point they let that relationship go unattended, sometimes notwithstanding losing enthusiasm when the deal been made, or far more detestable, they desert the customer when an effortlessly cured issue happens, just to need to spend another little fortune to supplant that customer. The least demanding approach to develop your business is not to lose your customers. When you stop the spillage, it’s frequently conceivable to twofold or triple your development rate in light of the fact that you’re no more compelled to make up lost ground just to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bring-back-the-lost-sheep&quot;&gt;2. Bring back the “lost sheep”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s little point in committing gigantic assets to creating new customers when 25-60% of your torpid customers will be responsive to your endeavors to recover their business on the off chance that you approach them the right route, with the right offer. Reactivating customers who definitely know you and your item is one of the least demanding, fastest approaches to expand your incomes. Re-reaching and helping them to remember your presence, discovering why they’re no more purchasing, defeating their complaints and showing that despite everything you esteem and appreciation them will more often than not bring about a gigantic abundance of offers and radically expanded incomes in a matter of days … and will prompt some of your best and most steadfast customer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-complaint-is-a-gift&quot;&gt;3. A complaint is a gift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;96 percent of disappointed customers don’t whine. They simply leave, and you’ll never know why. That is on the grounds that they regularly don’t know how to grumble, or can’t be annoyed, or are excessively panicked, or don’t accept it’ll have any effect. Whilst they may not let you know what’s wrong, they will surely tell a lot of others. A framework for uncovering protests can in this way be the soul of your business, in light of the fact that customers who gripe are giving you a blessing, regardless they’re conversing with you, they’re giving you another chance to return them to a condition of fulfillment and enjoyment them and the way in which you react gives you another opportunity to demonstrate what you’re made of and make significantly more noteworthy customer dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frequent-communications-calendar&quot;&gt;4. Frequent Communications Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstain from losing your customers by building connections and staying in contact utilizing a moving schedule of interchanges. This is a modified succession of letters, occasions, telephone calls, “thank you’s”, uncommon offers, subsequent meet-ups, enchantment minutes, and cards or notes with an individual touch and so on that happen continually and consequently at characterized focuses in the pre-deals, deals and post-deals process. Individuals not just react to this emphatically, they truly value it in light of the fact that they feel esteemed and vital. It recognizes them, keeps them educated, counterbalances post-buy questions, strengthens the reason they’re working with you and makes them feel a piece of your business so they need to return over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customer Loyalty Program Software for Restaurants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pegke is a customer loyalty programs for restaurants - as well, which utilizes the Smartphone and Tablet to manage the program; Pegke is the one solution that allows restaurants to create loyalty campaigns enabling them to attract more customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer loyalty has been vital to restaurants of numerous types subsequent to the idea of an “restaurant” was made. Loyal customers are the ones who will return regularly and spend as often as possible, which helps restaurants of all sizes meet their main concerns. However building loyalty is not another idea for eatery proprietors, the strategies used to approach building customer loyalty have changed throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ui image fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pegke.com/sites/default/files/uploads/customer-loyalty-program-software-for-restaurants.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Loyalty Program Software for Restaurants&quot; title=&quot;Customer Loyalty Program Software for Restaurants&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traditionally-customer-loyalty-has-been-managed-by-one-of-the-following-methods&quot;&gt;Traditionally Customer loyalty has been managed by one of the following methods.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;punch-cards&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punch cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punch cards are one among the earliest kinds of loyalty building techniques. although the inducement of “buy 10 meals and obtain the 11th free” still appeals to some diners, it solely permits restaurant owners to reward customers for one action out of the many that they take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-on-bill-discounts&quot;&gt;General on-bill discounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering a discount to all customers might seem like a generous move by the restaurant, but is it really helping your brand build lasting loyalty? Unfortunately, research shows otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that frequent customers already like your restaurant, and although a couple bucks off on a menu item is always nice, it’s not why they keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Is this for the future?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course its not&lt;/strong&gt;, thats why we made a &lt;strong&gt;Customer Loyalty &amp;amp; Retention Management Platform&lt;/strong&gt; which utilizes the Smartphone and Tablet to manage the program; Pegke is the one solution that allows restaurants to create loyalty campaigns enabling them to attract more customer flow to the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-using-pegke-customer-loyalty-program-for-a-restaurant&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of using Pegke Customer Loyalty Program for a Restaurant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specialized-store-front&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized store front&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very robust and customizable store front for your online store. You can make this place to promote your latest offers and Nuggets you publish via the vendor dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;store-settings&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can customize the check-in interval for your customers on your shop. Its a few clicks away. Also you can switch from price range store or check-in store anytime based on your Subscription level&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demographics&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best part of Pegke, you can view detailed graphs of your stores performance in real time, which will help you restructure your offers and Nuggets , if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;send-push-messages&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send Push Messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send Push messages to the customers. One of the impressive ways to enlighten customers, pickup sales and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        The Pegke Loyalty marks include the Pegke Loyalty name and logo, and any word, phrase, image, or other designation that identifies the source or origin of any of Pegke Loyalty&#39;s products. Please don&#39;t modify the marks or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Pegke Loyalty, or in a way that confuses Pegke Loyalty with another brand (including your own).
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ui small images&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;ui header teal&quot;&gt;Visual design of your website or application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Design your site with unique branding and logos. Do not copy or imitate the look and feel of the Pegke Loyalty website or apps, as this could create user confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If utilizing the Pegke Loyalty API to support your service or application, you must feature a prominent banner noting your service is &quot;not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Pegke Loyalty, Inc.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You must not use, display, mirror or frame (including in meta-tags or hidden text) Pegke Loyalty websites, or any individual element of Pegke Loyalty websites, Pegke Loyalty&#39;s name, trademarks, logos or other proprietary information, or the layout and design of any page or form contained on a page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui divider horizontal&quot;&gt;🎶&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Naming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You&#39;re entitled to say that your website or application is integrated with Pegke Loyalty (we like people integrating with Pegke Loyalty!), but please don&#39;t use the Pegke Loyalty marks as part of the name of your company, application, product, or service, or in any logo you create.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do not register a domain containing “Pegke Loyalty”, misspellings, transliterations or similar variations thereof. That would be very uncool.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do not apply for a trademark with a name including “Pegke Loyalty”, the Pegke Loyalty hash, transliterations or similar variations thereof.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui divider horizontal&quot;&gt;🌐&lt;/div&gt;

        A lot of companies talk about culture--their awesome office, fun events and great perks. But we view culture differently. We believe it&#39;s about rallying people who enjoy each other&#39;s company and respect each other&#39;s skill. It&#39;s about working alongside people you rely on to spar with you intellectually one moment, then grab tacos with you the next.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        We&#39;ve created a culture that rewards bright, driven, and fun-loving people. We take our work seriously. But ourselves? Not so much.
      &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;twelve wide column&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Allows a registered merchants to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, which can be used to make API requests without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Bearer Token may be invalidated using oauth2/invalidate_token. Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and usage of the previous token will no longer be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Only one bearer token may exist outstanding for an application, and repeated requests to this method will yield the same already-existent token until it has been invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As with all API v1.1 methods, HTTPS is always required.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tokens received by this method should be cached. If attempted too frequently, requests will be rejected with a HTTP 403 with code 99.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#web&quot;&gt;Web API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
An HTTP/JSON based API that allows you to build applications that interact with Pegke in more complex ways.
&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rta&quot;&gt;Realtime Activity API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
A WebSocket-based API that allows you to stream your in-store activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;ul class=&quot;ui list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#store&quot;&gt;Store Activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;web&quot;&gt;Web API&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apigility.org/documentation/auth/authentication-oauth2&quot;&gt;OAuth 2&lt;/a&gt; is a protocol that lets your app request authorization to private details in a customer’s and Business data to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
You’ll need to collect your OAuth tokens to make API calls, each merchant account is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret which will be used in the OAuth flow. The Client Secret should not be shared.
&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750&quot;&gt;Bearer Tokens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
The most common OAuth 2 token type. It provides very little in terms of security and relies heavily upon the ability of the client to keep the token secret &lt;a href=&quot;http://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/tokens/bearer.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3 id=&quot;auth&quot;&gt;Authenticate&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Since we are using &lt;strong&gt;OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token&lt;/strong&gt; you are always authorized &lt;strong&gt;if and only if&lt;/strong&gt; you are passing the header&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-http&quot;&gt;Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCES-TOKEN
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      &lt;h3 id=&quot;give&quot;&gt;Give Loyalty Points&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can give Loyalty points to any customer using &lt;strong&gt;Customer ID, Mobile Number, or Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;ui text segment pegke&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui accordion&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
      &lt;i class=&quot;dropdown icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      App token has expired!
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p class=&quot;transition hidden&quot;&gt;First, that is a good thing. Tokens are like cash, if you have it you can use it. You don&#39;t need to prove that token belongs to you, so don&#39;t let anyone steal your token. In order to lower the risk tokens should expire fairly quickly. If your token expires in 120s then it will be only usable during that window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
      &lt;i class=&quot;dropdown icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      What do I do if my token was expired?
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Along with your access token, an authentication token is created. It&#39;s called the refresh token . It&#39;s a longer lived token, that it&#39;s associated to an access token and can be used to create a replica of your expired access token. You can then use that new access token normally.

        To use your refresh token you will need to make a request against /simple-oauth/refresh providing the header Authorization: Bearer {YOUR REFRESH TOKEN}. That will return a JSON document with the new token. That URL can only be accessed with your refresh token, even if your access token is still valid.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
      &lt;i class=&quot;dropdown icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      What do I do if my refresh token was also expired?
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Then you will need to log into Drupal and go to your profile page to generate a new token from scratch. You can avoid this by refreshing your access token before your refresh token expires. This way you avoid the need to require the user to go to Drupal to create a new token.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Another way to mitigate this is to use longer expiration times in your tokens. This will work, but the the recommendation is to refresh your token in time.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In all actuality client experience does make a difference. Brands that can give fun, satisfying encounters through great deals stages and additional items like dedication projects have the capacity to catch more rehash clients, who pivot and get new clients they could call their own through image evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;ui hidden divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Amid the extreme center of attention on scoring revenue in a sea of competitors, it can be easy to omit what must be the precedence — successful a patron who sticks round long after the ultimate slice of ham is eaten and the lights come down. If the value of loyalty escapes you, understand this: consistent with Harvard business review, growing patron retention rates by just 5% raises gains with the aid of 25% to 95%.&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ui hidden divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The results of customer retention additionally compound after some time, and in at times unforeseen ways. Indeed, even a modest change in customer retention can course through a business framework and increase after some time. The subsequent impact on long haul benefit and development shouldn’t be thought little of.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Customer Loyalty ought to be a go-to methodology for any small business, yet the fact of the matter is, paying little heed to if the system is computerized or an old-school punch card, little entrepreneurs don’t feel like they have room schedule-wise to tackle more obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Reward programs are intended to exactly deliver this – be able to track and reward customer behavior. Statistics also indicate that consumer participation in rewards programs is on the rise across all demographic segments. With more customers choosing to do coupon and bargain shopping in the store, the reward programs that provide personalized rewards will prove to be differentiators if implemented with a laser sharp focus on targeted customer segments.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Aspects of modern marketing could be found in the practices of early traders and the bazaars of the Middle East…. traders in pre-Hellenic Greece displayed admirable customer focus, and the medieval book trade espoused a range of marketing strategies including selective distribution, celebrity endorsement, sponsorship and test marketing. Marketing functions were manifest in early joint-stock companies such as the East India Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company. While historians, by and large, will view the formation of the East India Company as a British prelude to the eventual conquest of the Indian subcontinent, a modern marketing strategist could view the East India Company, a tad charitably perhaps, as a British tactic to enter new markets with the ultimate aim of becoming the undisputed market leader in Southeast Asia. Such a view has parallels in the last century, and the best example is the invasion and eventual domination of the U.S. consumer electronic market by the Japanese via a seemingly innocuous presence in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering returning clients a rebate on administrations&lt;/strong&gt;
Everybody adores a decent arrangement. Subsequently, when a client comes back to you, it is a smart thought to remunerate them for returning. This doesn’t need to be an immense rebate; it can simply be a rate off of their bill.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving prizes for references&lt;/strong&gt;
Giving your present clients rewards for alluding different clients to you is yet another approach to demonstrate your present clients you admire their business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering overhauls&lt;/strong&gt;
On your Facebook or Twitter page, you can post overhauls about your business and even your own life - on the off chance that you are agreeable with that. This will make your clients feel like they know you. They will have within scoop, an off camera take a gander at what you are managing on any given day.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Have you defined your audience segments?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Have you created audience personas?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Have you identified your users red routes (key tasks)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do you use a user-centered approach?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do you conduct regular user testing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;optimise-and-refine&quot;&gt;Optimise and refine&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Banking &amp; Financial</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;ui basic fluid segment text&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At a time of unprecedented structural change in the financial services industry, banks and credit unions are contending with increasing challenges, including post-crisis regulations, a more demanding consumer and new competition from inside and outside the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations are responding by making significant investments in core systems &amp;gt; replacement, digital channels and data analytics to ensure their ongoing
competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While compliance with new regulations and new competitors remain a major challenge, maintaining customer loyalty is considered to be the financial industry’s biggest challenge, according to a study by Temenos. Cited by 30% of global senior bankers, there is concern that more empowered and better informed customers may begin to switch providers in greater numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Temenos’ 7th Annual Survey of Challenges, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.temenos.com/en-us/market-insight/universal-insight/temenos-7th-annual-survey-of-the-financial-services-sector/&quot;&gt;Priorities and Trends in the Financial Services Sector&lt;/a&gt; found that the industry overall views their biggest threat as being technology vendors, such as Apple and Google (cited by 23% of respondents). In comparison, the retail bank and credit union sector found existing large incumbents and new bank entrants to be the biggest threat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;two-major-findings&quot;&gt;Two major findings&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-surge-in-mobile-banking&quot;&gt;1. A surge in mobile banking&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;ui image left floated lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/banking_channel_mix.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mobile banking via smartphone or tablet is coming on strong in many countries. In the US, mobile usage jumped to 32% of customers from 21% in 2011. Usage in 2012 ranges from 47% of respondents in South Korea to 37% in India to 16% in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mobile banking is more likely to increase a US customer’s likelihood of recommending the bank than any other channel interaction. US customers especially love sophisticated features such as remote deposit capture (a digital image of an endorsed check), and they value the convenience of mobile devices for straightforward tasks such as checking a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In most European and Asian countries, customers cite online tools and transactions as having the strongest inﬂuence on their recommending a bank.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future is here and its name is “omnichannel”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If banks can take out costs in the processes that handle routine transactions, they will be able to serve mass segments more profitably and invest disproportionately in high-margin services for the afﬂuent. The way to accomplish this is through an omnichannel approach—integrating disparate digital and physical channels into a single, seamless experience—tailored to address the priorities of each customer segment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;ui image fluid lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/customer-loyalty-in-retail-banking-2012-fig-10_full.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the omnichannel world, branches play a different role: more as product showrooms, sales centers and venues for expert financial advice on complex matters, and less as transaction mills. Light but sturdy branches include more self-service terminals for routine tasks or product application forms and interactive tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty trends worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to loyalty rankings, it’s all relative. As banks review their Net Promoter scores, those with high scores may be tempted to compare across markets and declare themselves “best national bank” or “best credit union” globally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That would be misleading. Different countries exhibit structural differences in loyalty scores. We consistently find easier grading in some markets (the US and Mexico, among others) and very tough grading in others (the UK and France). Even within the US, we find variance among regions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;ui image fluid lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.bain.com/Images/customer-loyalty-in-retail-banking-2012-map_full.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;priorities-of-high-value-customer-segments&quot;&gt;2. Priorities of high-value customer segments&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the pace of regulatory change has abated somewhat, complying with complex new rules continues to require operational adjustment and high financial and human commitment. The challenge of complying with new regulations is considered much greater in the US and western Europe, where governments have potentially overcompensated for a perceived lack of regulation before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Private wealth management (PWM) and the universal banking sectors viewed regulation as their biggest threat in 36% and 28% of cases, respectively, caused by sector specific regulations that are onerous.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;other-concerns&quot;&gt;Other concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;h5 id=&quot;product-innovation-prioritization&quot;&gt;Product Innovation Prioritization&lt;/h5&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Correlating with the challenges of increased competition and consumer demands, product innovation was cited by 24% of the senior banker respondents to the Tememos survey, with 26% of retail bankers citing product innovation as their number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;ui image left floated lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/s_investment_priorities_9-28-2014-565x445.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The picture is similar with investment in digital channels, with 18% of overall respondents and 20% of retail banking respondents mentioning digital channels as top priority. Interestingly, 22% of private wealth management sector respondents said investing in mobile channels was their top priority, suggesting the importance of younger investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not to be forgotten, investing in branches remains a priority (7% vs. 12% in 2012), indicating that retail banks are updating branch formats, increasing investment in new branch technology while converting physical facilities to centers for sales and advice as opposed to transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h5 id=&quot;it-spending-explodes&quot;&gt;IT Spending Explodes&lt;/h5&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aligning with other studies, the Telemos research found that 67% of respondents expected higher IT budgets in 2014 and just 11% anticipated their IT budget to shrink, giving a net positive delta of 56%, higher than in 2013 (53%) and in 2008 (46%).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The trend illustrates how all banks, regardless of sector or geographical region recognize the priority of investing in IT to sustain competitiveness in the digital age. Real-time core banking system renewal built around customer records and not products, was cited as the number one IT investment priority for banks in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The second biggest priority for IT spending, cited by 23% of respondents, was digital channels, with the single biggest area of investment being mobile apps for tablets and smartphones, cited by 32% of respondents. Overall, 17% of respondents were directing most of their mobile bank spending to building out basic services, such as balance requests and transfers, illustrating the game of catch up that many banks are faced with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/planned_mobile_banking_investments_9-28-2014.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
